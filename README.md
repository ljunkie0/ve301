VE301 is a tiny program acting as an internet radio. It provides
an MPD client and an SDL window to choose the radio stations among
other things.
The display mimics the scale disk of a vintage radio like the ve301.
It runs on a raspberry pi as well as on a normal desktop (though for
the latter there are better mpd clients).
